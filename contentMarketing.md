# Content Marketing
## Types of content:
Below are the topics of the different types of content we would post on our website. It is worth noting that in most cases multiple types of content would be combined, so it wouldn't be just a recipe blog, but a recipe blog with a video to go with it, or when talking about the source of our produce, an infographic would be attached.

### Blog post topics:
  + The source of our products (The farmers)
  + Latvian traditional foods
  + Seasonal spotlights
  + Importance of sustainability
  + Recipes
  + Chef suggestions for home cooking
  + Customer Reviews and Testimonials

### Infographics topics:
  + The road from the farm to the restaurant table
  + Seasonal ingredient guide
  + Latvian festivities and related foods
  + Customer favourites (Top dishes)
  + Wine pairings

### Video content:
While some videos would also be posted on our social media accounts, having them available on the website would increase the sharability of the site and also increase our SEO rating.
  + Cooking instructions (to go along with the recipes)
  + Interviews:
    - With critics
    - With our staff
  + Short form content:
    - Cooking tips & tricks
    - Kitchen tools and how to use them

### Events
Hosting events and then making the images from these events available through our website will make people visit the site a lot more often, especially if the link to the site is shared through social media
  + Tasting events
  + Seasonal menu launch
  + Guest chef events

More types of events would be introduced as time goes on.

## Content Quality
To make sure our content is of good quality, we would take these steps:
  + Comprehensive research - since our restaurant prides itself on traditional Latvian cuisine and we would be posting content about these foods, it is important that the information we post is correct and backed by sources
  + Fact checking - while this does go hand in hand with the previous, it i≈° an additional step to ensure quality
  + Quality equipment together with Goods skills - It is important that we use equipment that can produce high-quality content (especially when talking about video) but with that, we also need people who know how to use it. Combining the two is key.
  + Relevancy and Timing - make sure that our content plan is relevant to what is happening in the industry, the country and the world. Make sure that content releases are not delayed and are published in time to have maximum effect.
  + Measure performance and react to it - we need to be following along with how well our content is doing and if something is not doing as well, then change it and try something else to find the perfect niche.

## SEO things to keep in mind:
Since all of this content would end up on our website, it's important not to forget about SEO. Here are the things to keep in mind when publishing this content:
  + Keywords in titles, headings, URLs, meta-descriptions
  + Using geo-specific keywords 
  + Content structure using various headings (h1, h2 and h3)
  + Internal links to our other relevant pages
  + Regular updates on the content that requires it, like the menu (Making sure it doesn't go out of date)
  + Evergreen content - making sure that our content remains relevant over time (not all content, some needs updates)
  + Create XML sitemaps
  + Make corrections to Robots.txt if needed
  + Social media sharing buttons on our pages so that they could be shared more widely

## Additional things to consider for the future:
  + Interactive map of ingredient sources
