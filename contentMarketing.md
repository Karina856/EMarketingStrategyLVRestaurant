# Content Marketing
## Types of content:
Below are the topics of the different types of content we would post to our website. It is worth noting that in most cases multiple types of content would be combined, so it wouldn't be just a recipe blog, but a recipe blog with a video to go with it, or when talking about the source of our produce, an infographic would be attached.

### Blog post topics:
  + The source of our products (The farmers)
  + Latvian traditional foods
  + Seasonal spotlights
  + Importance of sustainability
  + Recipes
  + Chef suggestions for home cooking

### Inforgraphics topics:
  + The road from farm to the restaurant table
  + Seasonal ingredient guide
  + Latvian festivities and related foods
  + Customer favourites (Top dishes)
  + Wine pairings

### Video content:
While some video would also be posted on our social media accounts, having them available on the website would increase the sharability of the site and also incrase our SEO rating.
  + Cooking instructions (to go along with the recipes)
  + Interviews:
    - With critics
    - With our staff
  + Short form content:
    - Cooking tips & tricks
    - Kitchen tools and how to use them

### Events
Hosting events and then making the images from these events available trough our website will make people visit the site a lot more often, especially if the link to the site is shared trough social media
  + Tasting events
  + Seasonal menu launch
  + Guest chef events
More types of events would be introduced as the time goes on.

## Content Quality
To make sure our content is of good quality, we would take these steps:
  + Comprehensive research - since our restuarant prides it self on traditional Latvian cuisine and we would be posting content about these foods, it is important that the information we post is correct and backed by sources
  + Fact checking - while this does go hand in hand with the previous, i≈° an additional step to ensure quaility
  + Quality equipment together with Goods skills - It is important that we use equpiment that can produce high quaility content (especially when talking about video) but with that we also need people who know how to use it. Combining the two is key.

## SEO things to keep in mind:
Since all of this content would end up on our website, it's important not to forget about SEO. Here are the things to keep in mind when publishing this content:
  + Keywords in titles, headings, URLs, meta-descriptions
  + Content structure using various headings (h1, h2 and h3)
  + Internal links to our other relavent pages
  + Regular updates on the content that requires it, like the menu (Making sure it doesn't go out of date)
  + Evergreen content - making sure that our content remain relavent over time (not all content, some needs updates)
  + Create XML sitemaps
  + Make corrections to Robots.txt if needed
  + Social media sharing buttons on our pages so tht they could be shared more widely
