SEO
SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” It is the process of getting traffic from the “free,” “organic,” 
“editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines. All major search engines such as Google, Bing and 
Yahoo have primary search results, where web pages and other content such as videos or local listings are 
shown and ranked based on what the search engine considers most relevant to users.
