# Social Media Marketing #

## Platforms ##
As our choice of social media platforms, we would choose:
  + YouTube - due to our large amount of video content on the website, it would be useful to also duplicate them on YouTube to gain interest from their large viewership
  + Facebook - Facebook is one of the main platforms used by our competitors, having a presence here would allow us to try to one-up the competition
  + Instagram - Since some of our content is short-form, Instagram reels would be useful for sharing them. Some might say TikTok would be more beneficial but as we see it, our target audience is not on TikTok and are more likely to use Facebook and Instagram

## Content Calendar ##
When it comes to social media, it's important to be consistent and also have varied content so that your audience doesn't get sick of it. Therefore we have devised a frequency of uploads on each platform as well as the type of content uploaded there. 

### YouTube ###
YouTube requires consistency and high quality so the aim is to find the balance between often uploads and your resources for producing the content. An upload per week should be sustainable to ensure both sides are fulfilled.

__Frequency:__ 1-2 times per week
  + Cooking instructions.
  + Interviews with critics and staff.
  + Event highlights and behind-the-scenes footage.
  + Short-form content on YouTube Shorts. (Doubles of our IG reels and potentially long-form video highlights)

### Instagram ###
Instagram favours more frequent and more visually appealing content so we can post and market a lot more
__Frequency:__ 5-7 times per week
  + High-quality images of dishes and behind-the-scenes shots.
  + Infographics and short video clips.
  + Stories for daily specials, quick updates, and event teasers.
  + Reels for short cooking tips, tricks, and kitchen tool demos.

### Facebook ###
Facebook is not as demanding of frequency as Instagram but requires more than YouTube. With Facebook, we benefit from more diverse content.
__Frequency:__ 3-5 times per week
  + Posts about blogs on your website
  + Infographics
  + Video (longer and shorter, but not all)
  + __Events__ and promotions for them
  + Sharing Customer reviews

## Influencer partnerships ##
When it comes to influencer partnerships, we would mainly focus on Latvian influencers as well as European travel influencers. As for the types of partnerships, that partially depends on the influencers themselves but from our side, we could offer:
  + Collaborative Cooking Videos & other content (YouTube, Instagram)
  + Guest Experience - Inviting them to our restaurant in order to review it (YouTube)
  + Event coverage (Youtube, potentially)
  + Cooking live streams (YouTube, Facebook, depends on influencers platform, maybe even Twitch)
  + Giveaways & contests (Facebook, Instagram)
  + Sponsored posts (Instagram, Facebook)
  + Instagram Takeovers for a day

Here are some influencers we would attempt approaching at some point:

## Engagement ##
It is very important to keep the audience engaged, so our social media team will need to be on guard to respond to comments and DMs. Of course, not every message needs an answer, but these channels need to be kept open and the audience needs to see that we actively engage, and react to their questions, jokes or suggestions. This needs to be done for all the platforms.
