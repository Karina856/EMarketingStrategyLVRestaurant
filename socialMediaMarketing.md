# Social Media Marketing #

## Platforms ##
As our choice of social media platforms, we would choose:
  + YouTube - due to our large amount of video content on the website, it would be useful to also duplicate them on YouTube to gain interest from their large viewership
  + Facebook - Facebook is one of the main platforms used by our competitors, having a presence here would allow us to try to one-up the competition
  + Instagram - Since some of our content is short-form, Instagram reels would be useful for sharing them. Some might say TikTok would be more beneficial but as we see it, our target audience is not on TikTok and are more likely to use Facebook and Instagram

## Content Calendar ##
When it comes to social media, it's important to be consistent and also have varied content so that your audience doesn't get sick of it. Therefore we have devised a frequency of uploads on each platform as well as the type of content uploaded there. 

### YouTube ###
YouTube requires consistency and high quality so the aim is to find the balance between often uploads and your resources for producing the content. An upload per week should be sustainable to ensure both sides are fulfilled.

__Frequency:__ 1-2 times per week
  + Cooking instructions.
  + Interviews with critics and staff.
  + Event highlights and behind-the-scenes footage.
  + Short-form content on YouTube Shorts. (Doubles of our IG reels and potentially long-form video highlights)

### Instagram ###
Instagram favours more frequent and more visually appealing content so we can post and market a lot more
__Frequency:__ 5-7 times per week
  + High-quality images of dishes and behind-the-scenes shots.
  + Infographics and short video clips.
  + Stories for daily specials, quick updates, and event teasers.
  + Reels for short cooking tips, tricks, and kitchen tool demos.

### Facebook ###
Facebook is not as demanding of frequency as Instagram but requires more than YouTube. With Facebook, we benefit from more diverse content.
__Frequency:__ 3-5 times per week
  + Posts about blogs on your website
  + Infographics
  + Video (longer and shorter, but not all)
  + __Events__ and promotions for them
  + Sharing Customer reviews

## Influencer partnerships ##
When it comes to influencer partnerships, we would mainly focus on Latvian influencers as well as European travel influencers. As for the types of partnerships, that partially depends on the influencers themselves but from our side, we could offer:
  + Collaborative Cooking Videos & other content (YouTube, Instagram)
  + Guest Experience - Inviting them to our restaurant in order to review it (YouTube)
  + Event coverage (Youtube, potentially)
  + Cooking live streams (YouTube, Facebook, depends on influencers platform, maybe even Twitch)
  + Giveaways & contests (Facebook, Instagram)
  + Sponsored posts (Instagram, Facebook)
  + Instagram Takeovers for a day

Here are some influencers we would attempt approaching at some point:
  + Pipars.lv - As someone who cooks and shares his recipes, he could be a good guest chef to invite to share the popularity. Sure he is not a top-level chef, but he is recognizable to the public
  + Airita KodrƒÅne (@airtata) - a smaller influencer that could get the information about us out on TikTok. While TikTok is not our platform of interest, it is worth remembering that any publicity is good publicity.
  + @JushkaPadrushka - She could be an influencer to partner for contests and giveaways as well as reviews.
  + Aija Nagle (@aijanagle) - Partnering with her could allow us to popularize us among the Russian-speaking audience. She has previously interviewed Michelin star restaurants aka our "idols" and competitors.
  + @food_feels - a larger influencer that could bring some international recognition to our restaurant
  + @eatdrinkrunrepeat - A European influencer with a goal to show food from all over Europe. Getting her to showcase our Latvian traditional dishes would be a win-win for both of us.

## Analytics ##
With each platform having different content and ways of engaging with said content, there are different analytics measured and taken into account.
### YouTube ###
  + Watch Time - measures how many minutes people have spent watching your video. The higher the number, the more engaging the video
  + Average View Duration - If most people are clicking off the video after the first seconds or minutes, we are not going to get anywhere with growing our audience. This tells us how engaging is our content.
  + Views - a basic indicator of how many people we reach
  + Subscribers - a way to see if our audience is growing and how many people want to see more of our content.
  + Engemnet - Likes, Comments, shares and more. Tracking this tells us that our content resonates with the audience.
  + Traffic sources and Demographics - allows us to better understand our audience and in the future make the content more appealing to them or identify the gaps in our audience coverage.

### Facebook ###
  + Reach - number of unique users that see our posts, a basic metric
  + Engagement - same as YouTube
  + Page likes and Follows - Similar to YouTube's Subscribers
  + Video metrics - Views, average watch time and others to measure the success of posting videos on the platform. Can help us identify what type of videos do better on FB and if we need them at all.
  + Event responses - Can allow us to estimate the number of guests we could have
  + Insights - Allows us to better understand our audience
  + Link clicks - Since we plan to share our blogs on facebook, its worth measuring to see if people are actually interested in that

### Instagram ###
  + Follower count - similar to Subscribers on Youtube
  + Engagement - same as YouTube and Facebook
  + Impressions - similar to Facebook's Reach
  + Website Clicks - How many times do people click on the links we share on our website or posts from there

### KPIs ###
Here are some KPIs to look through when managing social platforms
  + Engagement rate - how much people interact with our content compared to our follower count. if the number is low, then the follower numbers could be due to bots or just people who forgot to unfollow
  + Click-Trough rate - How many people click the links we provide. This is important when looking at our website's traffic too
  + Return on investment - how much revenue we gain from the social media activities compared to how much they cost us. Can help us identify which types of content are not worth for us to make.
  + Customer sentiment - Understanding the general perception of our business in the general public through comments and reviews.

## Engagement ##
It is very important to keep the audience engaged, so our social media team will need to be on guard to respond to comments and DMs. Of course, not every message needs an answer, but these channels need to be kept open and the audience needs to see that we actively engage, and react to their questions, jokes or suggestions. This needs to be done for all the platforms.
