# Social Media Marketing #

## Platforms ##
As our choice of social media platforms, we would choose:
  + YouTube - due to our large amount of video content on the website, it would be useful to also duplicate them on YouTube to gain interest from their large viewership
  + Facebook - Facebook is one of the main platform used by our competitors, having a presence here would allow us to try to one-up the competition
  + Instagram - Since some of our content is short-form, Instagram reels would be useful for sharing them. Some might say TikTok would be more beneficial but as we see it, our target audience is not on TikTok and are more likely to use Facebook and Instagram

## Engagement ##
It is very important to keep the audience engaged, so our social media team will need to be on guard to respond to comments and DMs. Of course, not every message needs an answer, but these channels need to be kept open and the audience needs to see that we actively engage, and react to their questions, jokes or suggestions. This needs to be done for all the platforms.
